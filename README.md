# VNRVJIET Search Engine for Research Publications
It is a web application that shows the publications information in a formatted way and also can perform searches on the publication according to the filter, the user can also insert a new publication data into the web application.

The resources required for developing this project include:
  1. Visual Studio
  2. MongoDB Connection String
  3. Google Auth ClientId
  4. NodeJS
  
The whole project is divided into 4 modules:
  * Module 1: Landing Page
  * Module 2: Publications Page
  * Module 3: Data Insertion Page
  * Module 4: Data Population 

## **MODULE-1: Landing Page**

As the project is a web application there is a need for the landing page.
This Module has 2 phases
 - Login Page
 - Home Page
 
We used React for the frontend. For the login Service we used the OAuth2 library for the google login.
 
## **MODULE-2: Publications Page**
 
In this module, we created a publication display page wher we display the data in a table format.
We provided the search options on the publications and download as csv option.
We used MongoDB as our database. The connection to the database was established and schema of the database is also defined.


## **MODULE-3: Data Insertion Page**

In this module, we created a page that would help the user to insert a new publication into database. 
For better user experiance we used mdb-react-ui-kit for the new publications page. The data is inserted into the mongodb by making a backend call from the frontend.

## **MODULE-4: Data Population**

Here, we have added some publications data of the college into the database from the web application.
The data used is the college publications data.

## **MODULE-5: Help**

The New Publication page features several parameters, which can sometimes be confusing for users. This module aims to clarify these parameters by providing users with a hands-on demonstration using sample entries, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of how they work.
